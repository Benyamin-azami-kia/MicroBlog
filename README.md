# MicroBlog

This is a very Simple MicroBlog, I Created it with Flask Framework as BackEnd and Bootstrap as FrontEnd.
You as Admin have Full  Control On Users, Posts, Comments...
Admin Has Below Items In his/her Dashboard:
<ul>
  <li>User List(You Can Delete Users but Don't ðŸ˜† )</li>
  <li>Add User</li>
  <li>Add Post</li>
  <li>Post List (you can Delete and Edit Posts)</li>
  <li>Comments(List Of Comments And Delete & Edit Options) </li>
  <li>. . . </li>
</ul>
I Made it just for my personal Usage but I did not Deploy it yet because i did not Complete some Features For Users Account Setting (not Admins)
